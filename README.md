“Hashem created the universe to sing to Him. Each element of creation brings out a different aspect, revealing Hashem’s majesty and 
flawless benevolence. The song are constant, filling the earth and the heavens. Even if the animals and inanimate creations have no 
mouths with which to sing, their very existence and function form a constant song of divine beauty. Yet, they can only properly express 
their message if we, the conductors, utter the verses that they sing and live according to their meaning. These songs, collected in 
Perek Shira, were traditionally composed by Dovid Hamelech and Shlomo Hamelech. The Sages speak at length of its recital and the reward 
of one who involves himself with it.”
(Excerpt from the Sefer “Perek Shira: The Song of Existence”, a comprehensive inspirational commentary on Perek Shira by R’ Shmuel 
Kraines, upon which these videos are based. It has the approbation of Rabbi Ze’ev Kraines, rabbi of Ohr Somayach Sandton, South Africa.)

Each video is comprised of two parts. The first part explains how the creature sings its verse through the meaning of its existence. The 
second part teaches how we can live our lives with the virtue expressed by the song. In essence, we are then singing this song with our 
own existence. Ultimately, the series shows how the life of each Jew is a song-script of unique praise of the Creator. Watch our 
presentations and learn how to read the music of the world.

The Song of Existence project is a production of inspirational Torah videos distributed free of charge and intended to reach thousands 
of viewers worldwide. They are produced one at a time, with no precedent funding to determine the length of the series. The project is 
therefore dependent entirely on public interest and contribution. All donations are used just to cover costs, which are a modest $230 
per professional video.

You can donate any amount using [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com) and direct the donation to our email address:

(Table last updated 17 Menachem Av)
The reward promised to one who involves himself with Perek Shira is immense. This surely applies equally to one who supports its 
dissemination. As it says in the introduction of Perek Shira:

Said Rebbi: Anyone who involves himself in Perek Shira in this world merits to learn and to teach, to safeguard, to do and 
to fulfill, his learning is retained in his hand, he is saved from the Yetzer Hara, bad incidents, blows  of the grave, the judgment of 
Gehinnom and the birth-pangs of Mashiach, merits long life, and merits to the days of Mashiach and the life of the World to Come.
