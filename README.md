We produce video presentations on Perek Shira and distribute them widely on popular sites such as TorahAnytime.com, which are visited by 
thousands of visitors daily. We do not charge money for them. If we can, we will go on to produce these uniquely inspirational 
presentations on a regular basis. However, we need $230 to produce each song of Perek Shira, just to cover the costs.

The reward promised to one who involves himself with Perek Shira is immense. This surely applies equally to one supports its 
dissemination. As it says in the introduction of Perek Shira:
Said Rebbi: Anyone who involves himself in Perek Shira in this world merits to learn and to teach, to safeguard, to do and 
to fulfill, his learning is retained in his hand, he is saved from the Yetzer Hara, bad incidents, blows  of the grave, the judgment of 
Gehinnom and the birth-pangs of Mashiach, merits long life, and merits to the days of Mashiach and the life of the World to Come.
