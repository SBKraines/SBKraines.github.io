“Hashem created the universe to sing to Him. Each element of creation brings out a different aspect, revealing Hashem’s majesty and 
flawless benevolence. The song are constant, filling the earth and the heavens. Even if the animals and inanimate creations have no 
mouths with which to sing, their very existence and function form a constant song of divine beauty. Yet, they can only properly express 
their message if we, the conductors, utter the verses that they sing and live according to their meaning. These songs, collected in 
Perek Shira, were traditionally composed by Dovid Hamelech and Shlomo Hamelech. The Sages speak at length of its recital and the reward 
of one who involves himself with it.”
(Excerpt from the Sefer “Perek Shira: The Song of Existence”, a comprehensive inspirational commentary on Perek Shira by R’ Shmuel 
Kraines, upon which these videos are based. It has the approbation of Rabbi Ze’ev Kraines, rabbi of Ohr Somayach Sandton, South Africa.)

Each video is comprised of two parts. The first part explains how the creature sings its verse through the meaning of its existence. The 
second part teaches how we can live our lives with the virtue expressed by the song. In essence, we are then singing this song with our 
own existence. Ultimately, the series shows how the life of each Jew is a song-script of unique praise of the Creator. Watch our 
presentations and learn how to read the music of the world.

The Song of Existence project is a production of inspirational Torah videos distributed free of charge and intended to reach thousands 
of viewers worldwide. They are produced one at a time, with no precedent funding to determine the length of the series. The project is 
therefore dependent entirely on public interest and contribution. All donations are used just to cover costs, which are a modest $230 
per professional video. You can donate any amount using Paypal and direct the donation to our email address:
